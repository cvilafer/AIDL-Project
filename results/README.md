Test Results for MS-ASL 1000

In the file "Test_Results_MS_ASL_1000.txt" you can see the final Test results for MS-ASL 1000

In the folder "test_frames_img_1000_mlp2_avg_class" there are all the images of the best frames selected by the model.

In the image file name (for example: 00018-cashier-athlete-fr8-p0.00MLP1.png) you can see: the image id, the correct sign, the infered sign, the frame number, the probability/confidence (0-1) from the inference and wether is the best frame from MLP1 or MLP2.
Really, at the end the model chooses the sign from MLP1 or MLP2 with the higher probability.
